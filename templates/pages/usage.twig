# HUB-3 Barcode API

This API specifies a single endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/barcode
```

Data is sent JSON encoded in the request body. Make sure to set your content
type header:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

On success, the server returns a **HTTP 200 OK** response, with the barcode
encoded in the response body. Content type depends on the renderer used.

## Request body

```javascript
{
    "renderer": "image",
    "options": { ... }
    "data": { ... }
}
```

The request body should contain a JSON object with the following keys:


| Key       | Type    | Description                                     |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| renderer  | string  | Name of the renderer to use.                    |
| options   | object  | Renderer-specific configuration.                |
| data      | object  | Data to be encoded into the barcode.            |

The **renderer** is the component which renders the barcode to the target
format. This can be an image, a SVG document or something else. Each renderer
has a set of **options** which configures it's behaviour.

## Barcode data

This is the data that will be encoded into the HUB-3 barcode. The data format
is defined by the
[HUB-3 standard](http://www.hub.hr/sites/default/files/2dbc_0.pdf).

| Key                  | Type           | Description                         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| amount               | decimal (15,2) | Transaction amount in HRK           |
| purpose              | text (4)       | Purpose code by ISO 20022 standard  |
| description          | text (35)      | Transaction description             |
| **sender**           | **object**     | Sender data                         |
| > sender.name        | text (30)      | Name and surname, or company name   |
| > sender.street      | text (30)      | Address (street and number)         |
| > sender.place       | text (27)      | Address (post code and place name)  |
| **receiver**         | **object**     | Receiver data                       |
| > receiver.name      | text (30)      | Name and surname, or company name   |
| > receiver.street    | text (30)      | Address (street and number)         |
| > receiver.place     | text (27)      | Address (post code and place name)  |
| > receiver.iban      | text (21)      | Account number (IBAN)               |
| > receiver.model     | text (2)       | Payment reference model             |
| > receiver.reference | text (21)      | Payment reference                   |

Sample barcode data:

```javascript
{
    "amount": 100000,
    "sender": {
        "name": "Ivan Habunek",
        "street": "Savska cesta 13",
        "place": "10000 Zagreb"
    },
    "receiver": {
        "name": "Big Fish Software d.o.o.",
        "street": "Savska cesta 13",
        "place": "10000 Zagreb",
        "iban": "HR6623400091110651272",
        "model": "00",
        "reference": "123-456-789"
    },
    "purpose": "ANTS",
    "description": "Developing a HUB-3 API"
}
```

The data is validated by a JSON schema which is available
[here](/schema/hub3.json).

A note about receiver _model_ and _reference_:

*  The **payment reference** is a string which is attached to the transaction and
   can be seen by the receiver. It typically contains information which helps
   the receiver identify the source and prupose of the transaction, such as a
   personal identification number (OIB) or a customer code.

   It typically contains one or more groups of numbers separated by dashes
   (e.g. 123-456-789), but this could change in the future.

* The **payment reference model** is a 2 digit string which defines the format
  of the reference string.

## Renderers

### Image Renderer

Returns the barcode as a JPG, PNG or GIF image.

#### Options

| Name    | Value                                    | Deafult   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| format  | Image format. One of: jpg, png, or gif.  | png       |
| padding | Padding size in pixels.                  | 20        |
| color   | Barcode color as a hex code.             | `#000000` |
| bgColor | Background color as a hex code.          | `#ffffff` |
| scale   | Width of the single unit in the barcode  | 3         |
| ratio   | Width to height ratio of a single unit   | 3         |

The *scale* and *ratio* will affect the size of the barcode image. Note that
the HUB-3 specification requires the *ratio* to be 3. If you change it, it might
not be readable by some devices.

#### Sample usage

```javascript
{
    "renderer": "image",
    "options": {
        "format": "png",
        "color": "#00ff00"
    }
    "data": { ... }
}
```

#### Sample response

Content-Type: **image/png**

| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| scale   | Width of the single unit in the barcode  | 3         |
| ratio   | Width to height ration of a single unit  | 3         |

    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,...],

    ...
]
```

# Errors

The API will always return **HTTP 200 OK** on success.

On error, it's possible to get one of the following:

#### HTTP 400 Bad Request

This means the data you sent doesn't pass validation. The response will contain
a JSON encoded error message, and possibly an array of validation errors.

For example, if you send invalid barcode data, you might see something like
this:

```javascript
{
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": [
        "data.amount: string value found, but a number is required",
        "data.sender.name: must be at most 30 characters long"
    ]
}
```

Or if you attempt to use a non-existing renderer:

```javascript
{
    "message": "Unknown renderer \"foo\".",
}
```

#### HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

Congratulations, you found a bug. Please
